## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Having been away from frontend development for a long while and also since I don't do it for a living - this challenge was more about getting the rust cleaned off and getting slowly up to speed again.

Also, working from a pre-defined layout is not something I have done often, so that was a good experience having a layout I didn't have to come up with myself. I have often found myself getting tired of a project, if I had to design it myself first.

### Continued development

As expected when I got started on this project, flexbox caused me most headaches. Flexbox is definitely something I need to work a lot more on.
