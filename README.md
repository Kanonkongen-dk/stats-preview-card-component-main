## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Since I have only been working with server side code for almost a year now, this challenge was more about getting the CSS-rust cleaned off and getting slowly up to speed again on frontend coding.

Also, working from a pre-defined layout is not something I have done often, so that was a good experience having a layout I didn't have to come up with myself. I have often found myself getting tired of a project, if I had to design it myself first. I just find coding a lot more fun than designing.

### Continued development

As expected when I got started on this project, flexbox and image handling caused me most headaches. This is definitely something I need to work a lot more on.
